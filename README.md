# HeimdallClientandAPI

Heimdall Client and API is a github project created to fulfill the requirements of a test issued by Heimdall Inc as part of the vetting process in an job application. 
I went a step further and created an integrated frontend Homepage that performs input validation using the API, favoring vanilla js/html/css to punctuate my prowess.
Other function calls were to be integrated but the idea was scratched for the sake of the tests brevity. Please use at your pace and thanks for the opportunity to participate. This was fun!
